      <h1>Hi, I'm Katy. (I'm the one on the right.)</h1><br>
      <p><img src="/images/katybio.png" alt="Katy and Arnold" class="me-pic">I am a Web Designer specializing in user experience and content strategy for web and mobile.<br><br>
      As a true child of the 80’s, my path as a designer began with Pee-Wee Herman, Lisa Frank, Trapper Keepers, Swatch watches and the
        Double Dare obstacle course.  I now know that the common aesthetic was inspired by the Memphis Design Group, but at the time I was
        innately drawn to the bright, bold and happy colors and shapes.<br><br>
      I recently moved back to my hometown of Cleveland from Los Angeles where I held administrative positions in a market research firm
        and a movie studio, among other places.  Looking back, it was the design-related tasks that I found most satisfying. Invitations to
        the Employee Appreciation Party, company-wide emails announcing the weekly fridge clean-out, and the client holiday cards were
        thoughtfully detailed, unexpectedly humorous, and exceedingly well-received. I also took pleasure in streamlining processes so that
        my bosses and co-workers would actually enjoy situations and tasks that were once avoided. Even so, I came to a point where I knew
        it was time to re-evaluate my career path.<br><br>
        UX design involves what I liked so much about my previous jobs and builds off of inherent characteristics that have been gestating
          since my childhood. In addition to being highly emphathetic and a keen observer, I am eager to be in a position where I am making
          a real impact on  people’s daily experiences.<br><br>
        It is my aim as a designer to bring joy and ease (and sometimes humor) into everyday tasks. I’m inspired by this quote from one of my design
          heroes,</p><br><br>

          <p class="centered">“When I was young, all we ever heard about was functionalism, functionalism, functionalism. It’s not enough. Design should also be
          sensual and exciting.” - Ettore Sottsass</p>
