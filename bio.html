      <p>As a true child of the 80’s, my path as a designer began with Pee-Wee Herman, Lisa Frank, Trapper Keepers, Swatch watches and the
          Double Dare obstacle course.  I now know that this common aesthetic was inspired by the Memphis Design Group, but at the time I was
          innately drawn to the bright, bold and happy colors and shapes.</p><br><br>
      <p>I recently moved back to my hometown of Cleveland from Los Angeles where I held administrative positions in a market research firm
          and a movie studio, among other places.  Looking back, it was the design-related tasks that I found most satisfying. Invitations to
          the Employee Appreciation Party, company-wide emails announcing the weekly fridge clean-out, and the client holiday cards were
          thoughtfully detailed, unexpectedly humorous, and exceedingly well-received. I also took pleasure in streamlining processes so that
          my bosses and co-workers would actually enjoy situations and tasks that were once avoided. Even so, I came to a point where I knew
          it was time to re-evaluate my career path.</p><br><br>
      <p>UX design involves what I liked so much about my previous jobs and builds off of inherent characteristics that have been gestating
          since my childhood. In addition to being highly empathetic and a keen observer, I am eager to be in a position where I can make
          a real impact on people’s daily experiences and interactions.</p><br><br>
      <p>It is my aim as a designer to bring joy and ease (and sometimes humor) into everyday tasks. I’m inspired by this quote from one of my design
          heroes,</p>
